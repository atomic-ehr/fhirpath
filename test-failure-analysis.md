# FHIRPath Test Failure Analysis

## Summary
- **Total Tests**: 761
- **Passing**: 735
- **Failing**: 26
- **TypeScript Errors**: Yes (10 errors in scripts/*.ts files)

## Categories of Failures

### 1. Parser Mode Tests (14 failures)
These tests are failing because they expect parser-specific metadata (diagnostics, AST info, etc.) but the test runner is evaluating the expressions and comparing runtime results instead of parser results.

**Pattern**: All tests in `parser/modes/mode-behavior.json` that expect:
- `diagnostics` array
- `hasAst` boolean  
- `error` boolean
- `valid` boolean
- `throws` boolean

**Root Cause**: The test runner's `runParserModeTest` function parses the expression correctly but the comparison logic is checking runtime evaluation results instead of parser metadata.

### 2. Parser Error Edge Cases (9 failures)
Tests in `parser/errors/edge-cases.json` and `parser/errors/syntax-errors.json` that expect specific parser error behaviors.

**Examples**:
- Empty expressions
- Invalid operators (`..`, `@`, etc.)
- Unclosed delimiters
- Missing operands

**Root Cause**: Similar to above - these tests expect parser diagnostics but are being evaluated as runtime expressions.

### 3. Range Tracking Tests (3 failures)
Tests that verify the parser tracks source locations correctly for error reporting.

**Root Cause**: The range tracking infrastructure exists but the test assertions are comparing against runtime results rather than parser diagnostic ranges.

## TypeScript Compilation Errors

All TypeScript errors are in the `scripts/` directory and relate to:
1. Missing type definitions for Bun subprocess API
2. Potential undefined object access
3. Missing `text` property on ContentBlock types

These are separate from the test failures and don't affect the core library functionality.

## Solution Approach

The failing tests are actually testing parser-specific behavior that's already implemented. The issue is that the test runner needs to be updated to:

1. Properly handle parser mode tests by checking the parser result structure instead of runtime evaluation
2. Add proper type guards for checking parser result types
3. Separate parser tests from runtime evaluation tests

The parser implementation itself appears to be working correctly - it's the test infrastructure that needs adjustment.
