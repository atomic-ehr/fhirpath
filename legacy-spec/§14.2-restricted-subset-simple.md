### Restricted Subset ("Simple")

This page documents a restricted subset of the [FHIRPath language](http://hl7.org/fhirpath) that is used in a few contexts in this specification. When the restricted FHIRPath language subset is in use, the following rules apply:

- All statements SHALL start with the name of the context element (e.g. on a Patient resource, Patient.contact.name.), or SHALL be simply "$this" to refer to the element that has focus
- Operators SHALL NOT be used
- Only the following functions may be used:
  
  - .resolve()
  - .extension("url")
  - .ofType(type)
  
  All other functions SHALL NOT be used

These rules exist to keep processing the path simple to support use of the path by processors that are not backed by a full FHIRPath implementation.

The following locations use this restricted FHIRPath language:

- [ElementDefinition.slicing.discriminator.path](elementdefinition-definitions.html#ElementDefinition.slicing.discriminator.path)
- [DataRequirement.dateFilter.path](metadatatypes-definitions.html#DataRequirement.dateFilter.path)
- [OperationOutcome.issue.expression](operationoutcome-definitions.html#OperationOutcome.issue.expression)

Unlike this rest of this page, the Factory API, the FHIR Terminology service API and the general server API (see below) are only draft (Maturity = 0). They will be advanced to a more mature status following the usual [Maturity Model](versions.html#maturity) for FHIR.
