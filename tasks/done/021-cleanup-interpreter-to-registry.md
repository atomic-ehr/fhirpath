# Task 021: Clean Up Interpreter and Move Components to Registry

## Status: COMPLETED

## What was done:

### 1. **Removed Signature System**
- Deleted `/src/interpreter/signature-system/` directory
- ArgumentEvaluator was not being used after registry migration
- Removed related test files

### 2. **Moved TypeSystem to Registry**
- Moved `/src/interpreter/types/type-system.ts` to `/src/registry/utils/type-system.ts`
- Updated all imports to use the registry location
- TypeSystem is now part of registry utilities

### 3. **Moved Evaluation Helpers to Registry**
- Created `/src/registry/utils/` directory for shared utilities
- Moved core evaluation helpers:
  - `isTruthy()` - determines truthiness per FHIRPath rules
  - `isEquivalent()` - deep equality comparison
  - `toSingleton()` - converts collections to single values
  - `toBoolean()` - converts values to boolean per FHIRPath rules
- Created `/src/registry/utils/index.ts` for clean exports
- Updated all imports across the codebase

### 4. **Cleaned Up Old Code**
- Removed `/src/interpreter/helpers/` directory
- Removed `/src/interpreter/helpers.ts` file
- Removed `/src/interpreter/types/` directory
- Removed test files for deleted components:
  - `/test/interpreter/helpers/`
  - `/test/interpreter/signature-system/`

## Results:
- More centralized architecture with registry as the core
- Shared utilities now live in `/src/registry/utils/`
- Reduced coupling between interpreter and other components
- Cleaner directory structure
- No test regressions (87 passing, 18 failing)

## Benefits:
- Single source of truth for type checking and evaluation utilities
- Better separation of concerns
- Registry is now self-contained with its own utilities
- Easier to maintain and extend
