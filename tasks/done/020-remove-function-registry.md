# Task 020: Remove FunctionRegistry and Use Registry Directly

## Status: COMPLETED

## What was done:

1. **Removed FunctionRegistry and related files**:
   - Deleted entire `/src/interpreter/functions/` directory
   - Deleted `/src/interpreter/functions.ts` file
   - All function logic now lives in the global Registry

2. **Updated the compiler**:
   - Added `import { Registry } from '../registry'`
   - Changed `FunctionRegistry.get(functionName)` to `Registry.get(functionName)`
   - Changed `FunctionRegistry.evaluate()` to direct interpreter evaluation
   - Removed all FunctionRegistry imports

3. **Updated test files**:
   - Rewrote `/test/interpreter/signature-system/function-registry.test.ts` to test Registry directly
   - Updated `/test/compiler.test.ts` to import the global registry
   - Tests now verify functions work through the Registry

4. **Results**:
   - No more FunctionRegistry references in the codebase
   - All function operations go through the unified Registry
   - Same test results (87 passing, 18 failing) - no regressions
   - Cleaner architecture with single source of truth

## Benefits:
- Eliminated duplicate registry system
- Simplified codebase structure
- All operations (operators, functions, literals) now use the same registry
- No more facade pattern needed
- Direct access to the unified Operation interface
