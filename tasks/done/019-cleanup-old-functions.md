# Task 019: Clean Up Old Function Implementations

## Status: COMPLETED

## What was done:
1. **Removed all old function implementation files** from `/src/interpreter/functions/`:
   - Deleted 10 files: core-functions.ts, existence-functions.ts, filtering-functions.ts, subsetting-functions.ts, combining-functions.ts, conversion-functions.ts, string-functions.ts, math-functions.ts, type-functions.ts, utility-functions.ts
   - Also removed unused validators.ts file

2. **Updated FunctionRegistry to be a facade**:
   - Converted FunctionRegistry to delegate to the global Registry
   - Added convertToLegacyDefinition() method to maintain backward compatibility
   - Kept the class for test compatibility but it now uses the global Registry

3. **Updated imports**:
   - Updated `/src/interpreter/functions/index.ts` to not import deleted files
   - Updated `/src/interpreter/functions.ts` to import the global registry
   - Updated `/src/compiler/compiler.ts` to import the global registry instead of old functions

4. **Maintained backward compatibility**:
   - FunctionRegistry.get(), has(), and evaluate() still work
   - Tests that use FunctionRegistry continue to function
   - Compiler can still reference functions (though it needs updating for operators)

## Result:
- All function logic is now centralized in the global Registry at `/src/registry/operations/`
- The `/src/interpreter/functions/` directory now only contains:
  - `index.ts` - exports for backward compatibility
  - `registry.ts` - facade that delegates to global Registry
- No duplicate function implementations exist
- All 87 interpreter tests that were passing still pass
