# Task 013: Implement Analyzer Cursor Mode

## Status: COMPLETED

## What Was Done

Successfully implemented cursor mode for the analyzer to support LSP integration:

1. **Added AnalyzerOptions interface** with `cursorMode` boolean option
2. **Extended AnalysisResult** with `AnalysisResultWithCursor` interface including:
   - `stoppedAtCursor` flag
   - `cursorContext` with type information and cursor node

3. **Implemented cursor detection and short-circuit logic**:
   - Analyzer checks for cursor nodes during both `visitNode` and `annotateAST` traversal
   - Stops immediately when cursor is encountered
   - Preserves all type annotations up to cursor position

4. **Added type context collection**:
   - `inferExpectedTypeForCursor` method determines expected type based on cursor context
   - Collects type before cursor for intelligent completions
   - Handles different cursor contexts (identifier, type, argument, index, operator)

5. **Updated AST traversal**:
   - Added checks after processing each child node to stop if cursor found
   - Prevents analysis of nodes after cursor
   - Maintains type information for all analyzed nodes

6. **Created comprehensive tests** (`test/analyzer-cursor-mode.test.ts`):
   - 13 test cases covering all cursor scenarios
   - Tests verify stopping at cursor, type preservation, and no analysis after cursor
   - All tests passing

## Key Features

- **Analyze-until-cursor**: Analyzer processes AST normally but stops at cursor nodes
- **Type preservation**: All nodes before cursor have complete type annotations
- **Context awareness**: Provides type context for LSP completions
- **Backward compatible**: Only activates when `cursorMode` option is true
- **Clean separation**: Returns undefined for cursor fields when not in cursor mode

## Example Usage

```typescript
const ast = parse('Patient.name.', { cursorPosition: 13 });
const result = analyzer.analyze(ast, undefined, inputType, { 
  cursorMode: true 
});

// result.stoppedAtCursor === true
// result.cursorContext.typeBeforeCursor has type of 'name'
// result.cursorContext.expectedType indicates what's expected after dot
```

## Summary

The implementation successfully enables the analyzer to work in LSP context by analyzing and annotating the AST with type information up to the cursor position, then stopping. This provides rich type context for intelligent completions while avoiding errors from incomplete expressions after the cursor.

## Objective
Add a `cursorMode` option to the analyzer that makes it stop analysis when encountering a cursor node, providing type-annotated AST up to the cursor position for LSP support.

## Background
Following the cursor node implementation (Task 012), we need the analyzer to work in LSP context where it should:
- Analyze and annotate the AST with type information up to the cursor
- Short-circuit when encountering a cursor node
- Preserve all type information collected before the cursor
- This enables intelligent type-aware completions based on actual types flowing through the expression

## Requirements

### 1. Analyzer Options
- Add `cursorMode: boolean` option to analyzer configuration
- When enabled, analyzer should stop traversal at cursor nodes
- Default to `false` for backward compatibility

### 2. Cursor Detection
- During AST traversal, check if current node is a cursor node
- When cursor is found in `cursorMode`:
  - Stop traversing children
  - Mark analyzer state as "stopped at cursor"
  - Return partially analyzed AST

### 3. Type Preservation
- All nodes before cursor must have complete type annotations
- Parent nodes containing cursor should have partial type info
- Type context at cursor position should be available

### 4. Analysis Behavior

#### Examples of expected behavior:

**Member access:**
- `Patient.name.` → Analyze Patient (type: Patient), analyze name (type: HumanName[]), stop at cursor
- Cursor context should know it's after HumanName[] type

**Function calls:**
- `Patient.where(active = true).` → Analyze where result (filtered Patient[]), stop at cursor
- Cursor context should know it's after filtered collection

**Type operators:**
- `value is ` → Analyze value, determine its type, stop at cursor
- Cursor context should know the type of 'value' for suggesting compatible types

**Function arguments:**
- `substring(0, ` → Analyze substring function signature, first argument, stop at cursor
- Cursor context should know expected type for second parameter

### 5. Implementation Areas

1. **Analyzer traversal logic:**
   - Add cursor detection in visitor pattern
   - Implement short-circuit logic
   - Preserve partial analysis state

2. **Type information collection:**
   - Ensure types are attached to nodes during traversal
   - Create type context for cursor position
   - Handle collection types properly

3. **Context building:**
   - Build context object with:
     - Type of expression before cursor
     - Expected type at cursor position
     - Available members/functions for that type
     - Parent expression context

### 6. Testing Requirements

Test cases should cover:
- Member access with cursor
- Function calls with cursor in arguments
- Type operators with cursor
- Index operations with cursor
- Nested expressions with cursor at various depths
- Collections and their types at cursor
- Complex expressions stopping at cursor

### 7. Integration Points

- Should work with existing cursor nodes from Task 012
- Should integrate with LSP helpers for completion
- Type information should be accessible for completion providers

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `cursorMode` option added to analyzer
- [ ] Analyzer stops at cursor nodes when in cursor mode
- [ ] All nodes before cursor have type annotations
- [ ] Type context is available at cursor position
- [ ] No analysis happens after cursor node
- [ ] Tests cover all cursor positions
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Type information can be used for intelligent completions

## Implementation Notes

- Use visitor pattern's return value to signal "stop traversal"
- Consider using a flag or state to track if cursor was encountered
- Ensure error handling doesn't break on incomplete expressions after cursor
- Type context should include both "current type" and "expected type"

## Example Usage

```typescript
const ast = parse('Patient.name.', { cursorPosition: 13 });
const analyzed = analyze(ast, { 
  cursorMode: true,
  input: patientData 
});

// analyzed.ast has type annotations up to 'name'
// analyzed.cursorContext has type info for completions
// analyzed.stoppedAtCursor === true
```
