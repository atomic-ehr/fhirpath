# Lexer Optimization Summary

## 1. Lookup Tables for Character Classification

### What was changed:
- Created lookup tables (`IS_DIGIT`, `IS_LETTER`, `IS_LETTER_OR_DIGIT`, `IS_HEX_DIGIT`) as `Uint8Array(256)`
- Replaced all function calls like `isDigit(charCode)` with direct array lookups like `IS_DIGIT[charCode]`
- Added bounds checking where needed (`charCode >= 0 && charCode < 256`)

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~1,477K expressions/second
- After: ~1,546K expressions/second
- Improvement: ~4.7%

### Why it works:
- Array lookups are O(1) and avoid function call overhead
- Modern JavaScript engines optimize array access very well
- Lookup tables fit in CPU cache (only 256 bytes per table)
- Eliminates branching in character classification logic

### Trade-offs:
- Slightly more memory usage (4 × 256 = 1KB for lookup tables)
- One-time initialization cost when module loads
- Need bounds checking for safety (charCode < 256)

## 2. Switch-based Keyword Lookup

### What was changed:
- Replaced object/hash map keyword lookup with nested switch statements
- First switch on keyword length (2-12 characters)
- Then switch on the actual keyword value
- Early exit for non-keyword lengths

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~1,546K expressions/second
- After: ~2,192K expressions/second
- Improvement: ~42%

### Why it works:
- Switch statements compile to jump tables in V8
- Length check filters out most identifiers immediately
- No hash computation or object property lookup
- Better CPU branch prediction
- Compiler can optimize switch statements very aggressively

### Trade-offs:
- More verbose code (but still maintainable)
- Fixed set of keywords (can't add dynamically)
- Slightly larger code size

## 3. Character Code Switch for readWhitespace

### What was changed:
- Replaced string comparisons (`char === ' '`) with character code switch
- Single `charCodeAt()` call instead of multiple string comparisons
- Switch statement on integer values (32, 9, 13, 10)

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~2,192K expressions/second
- After: ~2,240K expressions/second
- Improvement: ~2.2%

### Why it works:
- Integer comparison is faster than string comparison
- Switch on integers compiles to efficient jump table
- Single charCodeAt call vs multiple charAt/string comparisons
- Better branch prediction with switch statement

### Trade-offs:
- Slightly less readable (need to know ASCII codes)
- More verbose code structure

## 4. Reusable Token Attempt (Reverted)

### What was tried:
- Added a reusable token object to avoid allocations
- Created `setToken()` method to update and return the same object
- Modified `tokenize()` to clone tokens when storing in array

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~2,240K expressions/second
- After: ~1,995K expressions/second
- **Degradation: ~11%**

### Why it failed:
- Method call overhead for `setToken()` on every token
- Still need to clone tokens in `tokenize()`, negating the benefit
- The cloning actually made it worse than direct object creation
- V8's object allocation is already highly optimized for small objects

### Lesson learned:
- Not all traditional optimizations work in modern JavaScript engines
- V8's object allocation is very fast for small, short-lived objects
- Method call overhead can outweigh allocation savings

## 5. Token Representation Benchmarks

### What was tested:
Compared different approaches for token representation:
- Plain object literals `{ type, start, end }`
- Arrays `[type, start, end]`
- Classes with constructor
- Classes with fields
- Object.create(null)
- Object.assign and spread operators

### Performance Results:

#### Token Creation (5M tokens):
- **Object literal**: 8.09ms (618M tokens/sec) ✅
- **Class with constructor**: 14.45ms (346M tokens/sec) - 78% slower
- **Arrays**: ~28ms - 244% slower in real usage
- **Object.assign**: 224.68ms - 2678% slower
- **Spread operator**: 109.61ms - 1255% slower

#### Real Lexer Usage (100K iterations):
- **Object literals**: 54.06ms (9.2M expressions/sec) ✅
- **Arrays**: 180.79ms (2.8M expressions/sec)
- **Classes**: 169.79ms (2.9M expressions/sec)

### Why Object Literals Win:
1. **V8 Hidden Classes** - Objects with consistent shape share optimized hidden classes
2. **Inline Caching** - Property access is optimized through monomorphic inline caches
3. **No Constructor Overhead** - Direct allocation without function calls
4. **JIT Optimization** - V8 heavily optimizes object literal creation
5. **Better Property Access** - Named properties are faster than array indices for this use case

### Key Insights:
- Arrays are slower despite using less memory due to worse access patterns
- Classes add constructor overhead without benefits
- V8 is extremely optimized for plain object literals with consistent shapes
- The current implementation is already optimal

### Conclusion:
The current token representation using plain object literals is the fastest approach. No change needed.

## 6. Line and Column Tracking Added Back

### What was changed:
- Added `line` and `column` fields back to Token interface
- Track line/column during advance() method
- Capture startLine and startColumn for each token
- Update line/column in readWhitespace and readSpecialIdentifier

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~2,240K expressions/second (without line/column)
- After: ~2,147K expressions/second (with line/column)
- **Cost: ~4.2% performance decrease**

### Why it's acceptable:
- Line/column information is valuable for error reporting and debugging
- 4.2% overhead is reasonable for this functionality
- Still maintaining over 2M expressions/second
- Total performance is still 45% better than original implementation

### Implementation notes:
- Line increments on '\n', column resets to 1
- Column increments for all other characters
- Special handling in readSpecialIdentifier for multi-character advances

## 7. Numeric Enum Token Types

### What was changed:
- Converted TokenType from string enum to numeric enum
- String enum: `IDENTIFIER = 'IDENTIFIER'` → Numeric enum: `IDENTIFIER = 6`
- Added `tokenTypeToString()` helper function for debugging
- Added `debugTokens()` method for human-readable token output

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~2,147K expressions/second (string enums)
- After: ~2,200K expressions/second (numeric enums)
- **Improvement: ~2.5%**

### Why it works:
- Numeric comparisons are faster than string comparisons
- Smaller memory footprint (4 bytes vs string length)
- Better CPU cache utilization
- Switch statements optimize better with numeric values

### Trade-offs:
- Less readable in raw debugging output (see `6` instead of `"IDENTIFIER"`)
- Need helper functions for human-readable output
- Breaking change if external code depends on string values

### Debug Support:
```typescript
// Convert numeric type to string
tokenTypeToString(TokenType.IDENTIFIER) // "IDENTIFIER"

// Debug tokens
lexer.debugTokens() // "IDENTIFIER(foo) [1:1]\nDOT(.) [1:4]..."
```

## 8. CharCode-based Dispatch in nextToken()

### What was changed:
- Replaced char-based switch (`switch (firstChar)`) with charCode-based switch (`switch (firstCharCode)`)
- Use numeric character codes instead of string literals (e.g., `case 39:` instead of `case "'"`)
- Updated all case statements to use ASCII codes with comments showing the character
- Modified error handling to convert charCode back to string when needed

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~2,212K expressions/second (char-based dispatch)
- After: ~2,305K expressions/second (charCode-based dispatch)  
- **Improvement: ~4.2%** (93,132 more expressions/sec)

### Why it works:
- Integer comparison is faster than string comparison in switch statements
- JavaScript engines optimize numeric switches into jump tables more efficiently
- Avoids string indexing overhead when accessing characters
- Better CPU branch prediction with numeric values
- Single charCodeAt() call is more efficient than charAt() or string indexing

### Implementation Details:
```typescript
// Before
switch (firstChar) {
  case "'": return this.readString();
  case ".": return { type: TokenType.DOT, ... };
}

// After  
switch (firstCharCode) {
  case 39:  // '
    return this.readString();
  case 46:  // .
    return { type: TokenType.DOT, ... };
}
```

### Trade-offs:
- Less readable code (need ASCII code comments)
- Need to convert charCode back to string for error messages
- Slightly more complex error handling

### Isolated Test Results:
In isolated benchmarks, charCode dispatch showed 25% improvement over char dispatch. The smaller gain in the real lexer (4.2%) is due to:
- Other operations diluting the pure dispatch improvement
- Real-world expressions include various token types, not just operators
- Position tracking, token creation, and other overhead

## 9. Lookup Table for nextToken() Dispatch (Attempted)

### What was tried:
- Created a lookup table mapping character codes to token types for single-character tokens
- Used array indexing instead of switch statement for dispatch
- Aimed to reduce branching and improve performance

### Implementation approach:
```typescript
// Lookup table initialization
private static readonly CHAR_TOKEN_TABLE: (TokenType | null)[] = new Array(256).fill(null);
static {
  this.CHAR_TOKEN_TABLE[46] = TokenType.DOT;        // .
  this.CHAR_TOKEN_TABLE[40] = TokenType.LPAREN;     // (
  // ... etc
}

// Dispatch logic
const tokenType = CHAR_TOKEN_TABLE[firstCharCode];
if (tokenType !== null) {
  this.advance();
  return { type: tokenType, ... };
}
// Fall back to switch for complex cases
```

### Performance Impact:
- Switch-based: ~7,164K expressions/second
- Lookup table: ~3,990K expressions/second
- **Result: 79.5% SLOWER**

### Why it failed:
1. **V8 Optimization** - Modern JavaScript engines compile numeric switches into highly optimized jump tables
2. **Array Access Overhead**:
   - Array bounds checking on every access
   - Memory indirection (fetch from array)
   - Potential cache misses
   - Additional null check required
3. **Two-Stage Dispatch** - Still need switch/if-else fallback for complex tokens
4. **CPU Branch Prediction** - Modern CPUs predict switch branches very well
5. **Inline Optimization** - V8 can inline entire switch statement, but not array lookups

### Detailed Test Results:
- **Regular expressions test**: 79.5% slower with lookup table
- **Operator-heavy expressions**: 43.9% slower with lookup table
- The more operators (which benefit most from lookup), the less severe the penalty
- But still significantly slower in all cases

### Lesson learned:
- Not all traditional C/C++ optimizations translate to JavaScript
- V8's switch statement optimization is extremely efficient for numeric cases
- Array lookups in hot paths can be slower than well-optimized switches
- The current switch-based implementation is already optimal

### Current Performance Summary:
- Original: ~1,477K expressions/second
- Current: ~2,305K expressions/second
- **Total improvement: ~56%**

### Conclusion:
The current switch-based implementation with charCode dispatch represents the optimal approach for the nextToken() method. Further optimization efforts should focus on other areas of the lexer.

## 10. Unicode Support (Added then Removed)

### What was attempted:
- Added full Unicode support for identifiers using regex patterns `/\p{L}|\p{Nl}/u` and `/\p{L}|\p{N}|\p{M}|\p{Pc}/u`
- Allowed Unicode characters in regular identifiers (e.g., `café`, `日本語`)
- Extended support to environment variable identifiers

### Performance Impact:
- Before Unicode: ~2,305K expressions/second
- With Unicode: ~1,908K expressions/second
- **Result: 17% performance degradation**

### Why it was removed:
1. **Not spec compliant** - FHIRPath grammar explicitly defines identifiers as `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`
2. **Unicode is only allowed in**:
   - String literals: `'café'`, `'日本語'`
   - Delimited identifiers: `` `café` ``, `` `日本語` ``
   - Environment variable strings: `%'café'`, `%`日本語``
3. **Performance cost** - Regex checks with Unicode property escapes are expensive

### Implementation Details:
The original implementation used regex for every character:
```typescript
function isUnicodeIdentifierStart(char: string): boolean {
  return /\p{L}|\p{Nl}/u.test(char);  // Expensive!
}
```

### Final Resolution:
- Removed all Unicode support from regular identifiers
- Kept ASCII-only lookup tables for maximum performance
- Unicode remains supported in strings and delimited identifiers as per spec
- Performance restored to ~2,303K expressions/second

### Lesson learned:
- Always verify spec compliance before implementing features
- Unicode regex operations have significant performance overhead
- Following the spec can lead to better performance

### Current Performance Summary:
- Original: ~1,477K expressions/second
- Current: ~2,893K expressions/second
- **Total improvement: ~96%**

## 11. Optimize readSpecialIdentifier (Avoid substring)

### What was changed:
- Replaced `substring()` call with direct character code comparisons
- Check each character individually using `charCodeAt()` 
- Avoid allocating a new string object for lookahead

### Implementation:
```typescript
// Before: const ahead = this.input.substring(this.position, this.position + 6);
// After: Direct charCode checks
if (pos + 4 < len &&
    this.input.charCodeAt(pos + 1) === 116 && // t
    this.input.charCodeAt(pos + 2) === 104 && // h
    this.input.charCodeAt(pos + 3) === 105 && // i
    this.input.charCodeAt(pos + 4) === 115) { // s
  // $this
}
```

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~2,303K expressions/second
- After: ~2,893K expressions/second
- **Improvement: ~25.6%**

### Why it works:
- Avoids string allocation overhead
- Direct integer comparisons are faster than string operations
- No temporary objects created
- Better memory locality

## 12. Remove Redundant Bounds Checking for Lookup Tables

### What was changed:
- Removed unnecessary upper bound checks (`< 256`) from lookup table accesses
- Changed from `charCode >= 0 && charCode < 256 && IS_DIGIT[charCode]` to `charCode !== -1 && IS_DIGIT[charCode]`
- Applied to all lookup table uses: IS_DIGIT, IS_LETTER, IS_LETTER_OR_DIGIT, IS_HEX_DIGIT

### Why the optimization works:
1. **charCodeAt() always returns valid values** - Either 0-65535 or NaN (never negative except our -1 sentinel)
2. **JavaScript arrays handle out-of-bounds gracefully** - Returns `undefined` which is falsy
3. **Only need to check for -1** - Our EOF sentinel value from peekCharCode()
4. **Reduces comparisons** - From 3 comparisons to 1 per lookup

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~2,893K expressions/second
- After: ~4,454K expressions/second  
- **Improvement: ~54%**

## 13. Add Dedicated EOF Case to Switch Statement

### What was changed:
- Added explicit `case -1:` for EOF in the main switch statement
- Removed redundant EOF check from the default case
- Simplified default case by removing `firstCharCode !== -1` checks

### Implementation:
```typescript
// Before: 
default:
  if (firstCharCode !== -1 && IS_DIGIT[firstCharCode]) { ... }
  if (firstCharCode !== -1 && IS_LETTER[firstCharCode]) { ... }
  if (firstCharCode === -1) { return EOF; }

// After:
case -1:
  return { type: TokenType.EOF, ... };
default:
  if (IS_DIGIT[firstCharCode]) { ... }
  if (IS_LETTER[firstCharCode]) { ... }
```

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~4,454K expressions/second
- After: ~4,497K expressions/second
- **Improvement: ~1%**

### Why it works:
- Eliminates redundant EOF checks in the default case
- Switch statement handles EOF directly without falling through
- Cleaner code path for the common case

## 14. Avoid Substring Allocation in readIdentifierOrKeyword

### What was changed:
- Replaced `substring()` call with direct character code comparisons for common keywords
- Check keywords directly from the input buffer using charCodeAt()
- Only use substring for longer, less common keywords (6+ characters)

### Implementation:
```typescript
// Before: 
const value = this.input.substring(start, this.position);
switch (value) {
  case 'true': type = TokenType.TRUE; break;
  // ... many string comparisons
}

// After:
// For length 4 example:
const c0_4 = input.charCodeAt(start);
if (c0_4 === 116 && // 't'
    input.charCodeAt(start + 1) === 114 && // 'r'
    input.charCodeAt(start + 2) === 117 && // 'u'
    input.charCodeAt(start + 3) === 101) { // 'e'
  type = TokenType.TRUE;
}
```

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~4,497K expressions/second
- After: ~5,656K expressions/second
- **Improvement: ~26%**

### Why it works:
1. **Avoids string allocation** - No substring object created for most keywords
2. **Direct integer comparisons** - Faster than string equality checks
3. **Optimized for common cases** - Most keywords are 2-5 characters
4. **Falls back gracefully** - Still uses substring for rare long keywords

### Trade-offs:
- More verbose code (but still maintainable with comments)
- Larger code size due to unrolled comparisons
- Best for hot paths with frequent keyword checking

## 15. Inline advance() Method in Hot Paths

### What was changed:
- Inlined `advance()` method in the most frequently called code paths
- Replaced `this.advance()` with direct `this.position++; this.column++` 
- Applied to: single-character tokens, two-character operators, identifier/number reading loops

### Where inlined:
1. **nextToken() switch cases** - All single-character tokens (., (, ), +, -, *, =, etc.)
2. **Two-character operators** - <, >, !, and their combinations (<=, >=, !=, !~)
3. **Tight loops** - readIdentifierOrKeyword, readNumber digit scanning

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~5,656K expressions/second
- After: ~6,042K expressions/second
- **Improvement: ~7%**

### Why it works:
1. **Eliminates function call overhead** - No stack frame allocation/deallocation
2. **Better inlining by JIT** - Compiler can optimize the inlined code better
3. **Removes unused work** - advance() returns a value that's rarely used
4. **Hot path optimization** - These paths are executed millions of times

### Trade-offs:
- Code duplication (position++ and column++ repeated)
- Harder to maintain if line/column tracking logic changes
- Must remember to handle newlines separately where needed

## 16. Use CharCode Instead of Char in String/Delimiter Reading

### What was changed:
- Replaced string comparisons with character code comparisons in string reading methods
- Applied to: `readString()`, `readDelimitedIdentifier()`, `readEnvVar()`
- Changed `char === "'"` to `charCode === 39` etc.

### Implementation:
```typescript
// Before:
if (char === quoteChar) { ... }
if (char === '\\') { ... }
switch (escaped) {
  case "'": ...
  case "n": ...
}

// After:
if (charCode === quoteCharCode) { ... }
if (charCode === 92) { // \\
switch (escapedCode) {
  case 39:  // '
  case 110: // n
}
```

### Performance Impact:
- Before: ~6,042K expressions/second
- After: ~6,093K expressions/second
- **Improvement: ~1%**

### Why it works:
- Integer comparisons faster than string comparisons
- Consistent with the optimization pattern used in nextToken()
- Avoids string allocation for single character comparisons
- Better for hot paths that process many characters

## 17. Inline peek() and advance() in readString

### What was changed:
- Inlined `peekCharCode()` and `advance()` calls in the `readString()` method
- Replaced method calls with direct buffer access and position/column updates
- Applied specifically to string parsing which is a hot path for string-heavy expressions

### Implementation:
```typescript
// Before:
const charCode = this.peekCharCode();
if (charCode === quoteCharCode) {
  this.advance();
  return { type: TokenType.STRING, ... };
}

// After:
const charCode = this.input.charCodeAt(this.position);
if (charCode === quoteCharCode) {
  this.position++;
  this.column++;
  return { type: TokenType.STRING, ... };
}
```

### Performance Impact:
- **String-heavy expressions**: ~31% improvement (3.0M → 4.0M expressions/second)
- **Overall benchmark**: Mixed results (slight decrease in some tests)
- Decision: Applied to `readString()` only, not to other methods

### Why it works for strings:
1. **String parsing is advance-heavy** - Each character requires an advance() call
2. **Eliminates method call overhead** - Direct buffer access is faster
3. **Better locality** - All operations on adjacent memory
4. **Escape sequence handling** - Multiple advance() calls for escape sequences benefit greatly

### Trade-offs:
- **Code size increase** - Method becomes larger and more complex
- **Maintenance burden** - Must handle line/column tracking manually
- **Mixed performance impact** - Benefits string-heavy code but may hurt instruction cache
- **JIT optimization** - Very large methods may be harder for JIT to optimize

### String-Heavy Performance Test Results:

Comprehensive benchmarks show the significant impact of this optimization on string processing:

**Test Categories and Results:**
- **Long strings**: 2,171,821 expr/sec (strings with 100+ characters)
- **Escaped strings**: 2,512,563 expr/sec (strings with escape sequences like \n, \t, \\)
- **Unicode strings**: 2,061,856 expr/sec (strings with \uXXXX escape sequences)
- **Multiple strings**: 816,327 expr/sec (expressions with multiple string concatenations)
- **FHIR expressions**: 1,179,941 expr/sec (real-world FHIR queries with string literals)
- **Environment variables**: 1,494,768 expr/sec (string-based environment variables)

**Overall String-Heavy Performance**: 1,483,680 expressions/second

**Comparison with Simple Expressions**:
- Simple expressions (identifiers, operators): 4,132,231 expr/sec
- String-heavy slowdown: 2.71x
- The ~31% improvement from inlining is crucial for maintaining acceptable string performance

**Conclusion**: 
The peek/advance inlining in readString provides essential performance for string-heavy workloads. Without this optimization, string processing would be ~31% slower, making string-heavy expressions run at only ~1.13M expr/sec instead of ~1.48M expr/sec.

### Current Performance Summary:
- Original: ~1,477K expressions/second
- Current: ~6,093K expressions/second
- **Total improvement: ~313%** (4.1x faster than original)

## 18. Added Optional Trivia/Channel Support

### What was changed:
- Added `Channel` enum with `REGULAR` and `HIDDEN` values
- Added optional `channel` property to Token interface
- Added `preserveTrivia` option to LexerOptions
- Modified whitespace and comment tokens to include `Channel.HIDDEN` when `preserveTrivia` is true
- Updated `nextToken` to return trivia tokens when `preserveTrivia` is enabled

### Implementation:
```typescript
export enum Channel {
  REGULAR = 0,
  HIDDEN = 1,
}

export interface Token {
  // ... existing properties
  channel?: Channel;
}

export interface LexerOptions {
  skipWhitespace?: boolean;
  skipComments?: boolean;
  preserveTrivia?: boolean;  // New option
}
```

### Performance Impact:
- **Without preserveTrivia**: 2,730,350 expressions/second (default)
- **With preserveTrivia**: 1,737,645 expressions/second
- **Overhead**: 36.4% slower when enabled
- Channel assignment only happens when explicitly requested
- No performance penalty for users who don't need trivia

The overhead is expected because:
1. Whitespace and comment tokens are returned instead of skipped
2. Each trivia token requires channel assignment
3. More tokens are created and added to the result array
4. Typical expressions have 30-50% trivia tokens

### Why it's important:
1. **Code Formatters** - Need to preserve whitespace and comments
2. **Refactoring Tools** - Must maintain original formatting
3. **Documentation Generators** - Extract comments for API docs
4. **Round-trip Parsing** - Parse → Modify → Serialize preserves formatting
5. **Compatibility** - Matches original lexer's channel support

### Usage:
```typescript
// Preserve all trivia
const lexer = new Lexer(code, { preserveTrivia: true });
const tokens = lexer.tokenize();

// Filter by channel
const regularTokens = tokens.filter(t => t.channel !== Channel.HIDDEN);
const triviaTokens = tokens.filter(t => t.channel === Channel.HIDDEN);
```

### Current Performance Summary:
- Original: ~1,477K expressions/second
- Current: ~2,730K expressions/second (real-world expressions)
- Current: ~6,093K expressions/second (simple benchmark)
- **Total improvement: ~85%** (real-world) to **313%** (simple)
- With trivia enabled: ~1,738K expressions/second (36.4% overhead)

## 19. Performance Comparison with ANTLR

### What was tested:
- Compared hand-optimized Lexer2 with ANTLR-generated lexer
- Used same test suite: 1,539 real-world FHIRPath expressions
- 10,000 iterations per expression (~15.4 million tokens)
- ANTLR lexer generated from official FHIRPath grammar (spec/fhirpath.g4)

### Performance Results:
- **Lexer2**: 2,820,268 expressions/second
- **ANTLR**: 725,684 expressions/second
- **Performance advantage: 3.89x faster**

### Why Lexer2 Outperforms ANTLR:

#### Lexer2 Optimizations:
1. **Lookup tables** - O(1) character classification
2. **CharCode dispatch** - Integer switches instead of string comparisons
3. **Inlined hot paths** - Reduced function call overhead
4. **Optimized keywords** - Switch by length then value
5. **Minimal allocations** - Simple object literals

#### ANTLR Overhead:
1. **Generic DFA/NFA** - Flexible but less optimized
2. **Heavy tokens** - Complex Token class with many properties
3. **Stream abstractions** - Multiple indirection layers
4. **Error recovery** - Built-in but adds overhead
5. **Memory usage** - Larger token objects and buffering

### Trade-offs:
- **Lexer2**: Maximum performance, requires manual maintenance
- **ANTLR**: Grammar-based, easier to modify, good tooling

### Conclusion:
The hand-optimized approach provides substantial performance benefits (3.89x) for performance-critical applications like FHIRPath evaluation. ANTLR remains valuable for prototyping and when 725K expr/sec is sufficient.

### Final Performance Summary:
- **vs Original implementation**: ~85% improvement (real-world)
- **vs ANTLR-generated lexer**: ~289% improvement (3.89x faster)
- **Absolute performance**: 2.82M expressions/second

### Remaining Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Optimize readDateTime/readTimeFormat** - Reduce redundant charCode lookups
2. **Consider selective inlining** - Apply only where measurable benefit exists
3. **Profile-guided optimization** - Focus on actual hot paths in real usage
4. **Add offset property** - For complete position tracking compatibility
